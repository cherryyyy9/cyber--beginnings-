# cyber--beginnings

## 🗓️ Day 1  30. July. 2025
- ✅ Completed TryHackMe's *Offensive and Defensive Security Introduction*  
- ✅ Learned the basics of Junior Penetration Testing  
- ✅ Covered 'What is Networking?' — concepts + fundamentals  
- 📝 Took detailed notes for all topics

## Day 2 31.July.2025

- ✅ Completed TryHackMes linux fundamentals 1
- ✅ duos german lesson 
- ✅ ran first python code very basic 

What else I did today:

☑️ Learned how to take user input in Python.


☑️ Built my first Magic 8 Ball script (IT WORKED!!!).



☑️ Practiced writing conditional statements.


☑️ Ran code in Termux again. 


💡 What I learned:

input() makes the code talk to me.

random.choice() gives one answer, not a whole party.

if/elif/else control the flow like a DJ.


❌ What went wrong:

Tried to loop the 8-ball → chaos. All answers showed up.

while True: acted like a toxic ex—never knew when to stop.


🧠 Next up:

Learn while loops properly.

Add some color to the terminal output for ✨drama✨.

Maybe let the 8 Ball repeat until user types “exit”.




## Day 3 - 1. Aug. 2025 

- ✅ daily duo lesson 
- ✅ Completed Password Strength Checker mini-project

- ✅ Used if. 

- ✅ Ran script in Termux again like the terminal had beef with me


What I did today:

☑️ Took user input for a password (the script talked back, again).

☑️ Checked if it had lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols, and length ≥ 8.

☑️ Used multiple if conditions to score password strength.

☑️ Printed final judgment: weak / medium / strong — cold but fair.


💫 File saved as "python password_strength.py"

💡 What I learned:

any(char.isupper() for char in password) → I see you, uppercase scanner.

Logical chaining with if, elif, else makes the script feel like a mini-detective.

It’s not about the code being long — it’s about it being sharp.


❌ What went wrong:

Fought with an if condition for 15 minutes like it owed me money.

Forgot colons once. Python judged me.

Thought I was coding, realized I was just parroting — but hey, parrots learn to talk before they scream philosophy.
