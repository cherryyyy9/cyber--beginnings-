 Now what else did I do?


☑️ Learned how to take user input in Python.

☑️ Built my first Magic 8 Ball script (IT WORKED!!!).

☑️ Practiced writing conditional statements.

☑️ Ran code in Termux.


💡 What I learned:

input() makes the code talk to me.

random.choice() gives one answer, not a whole party.




❌ What went wrong:

Tried to loop the 8-ball → chaos. All answers showed up. fixed it later.

while True: acted like a toxic ex—never knew when to stop.


🧠 Next up:

Learn while loops properly.

Add some color to the terminal output for ✨drama✨.

Maybe let the 8 Ball repeat until user types “exit”.
